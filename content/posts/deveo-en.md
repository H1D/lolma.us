[Deveo.com](https://deveo.com) â€” is a service offering private repositories: Git, SVN and Mercurial.

Deveo [team](https://deveo.com/about/) is amazing, a real pleasure to work with.

Here's my [salutatory post](http://blog.deveo.com/andrey-mikhaylov-lolmaus-has-joined-deveo/) in the official Deveo blog.

And guess what, my first assignment is an open source project: the [ember-emojione](https://github.com/Deveo/ember-emojione) addon. You'll hear more about it soon.
