A sophisticated form was generated dynamically according to a structure determined by the backend.\n\nThe resulting data selections were presented as various graphs built with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo) for analytics.\n\nThe admin panel also offered an email builder — for both newsletters and individual messages. All email templates were rendered live into a thumbnail gallery. The gallery could be filtered.\n\nHell'o Baby homepage contains complex canvas animations, designed by company's artists. In order to keep performance stable, I had to orchestrate animations, so that only currently visible animations were playing. Animations that appeared nearby were synchronized.\n"
